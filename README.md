## What is Above The Pale
Above The Pale is a mobile or web app that will help homeless or displaced individuals find assistance. The idea came to me from an app called WarmShowers. WarmShowers is a worldwide hospitality app for touring cyclist. It allows kind-hearted people to provide a home for cyclists who are in the middle of a long ride. It connects those that need a place to stay and the goodwill of those willing to let a cyclists spend the night. 

Above The Pale works in a similar fahsion. It is designed to connect those that need help and those who are willing to provide that help, with the assistance of Google Map API

# Users
## App Perspective From A Volunteer
Someone who wishes to help will be able to create an account. With a [verified](#extra-information) account they will be able to set a point on Google Maps where they wish to provide aid. This can be anywhere from their own homes if they wish to the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. They will be able to specify exactly what it is they are providing. Other users of this app will be able to see where this point is and what is exactly being provided. This can range anywhere from clothing, food, a warm shower, company, a place to stay, or even employment.

## App Perspective From Someone In Need
Someone who has the app and is just looking for aid will not have an account. They will just have access to a map with locations of those willing to provide aid.

## From a Junior Software Developer Perspective
Even though this project is one I've wanted to build for a long time and just a side project, it will allow me to learn a lot of new useful skills. One of those is how to work with the Google Maps API. The Google Maps API will be most of the UI/UX. It is widely used and intuitive for most people. It is also easy to understand and learn for those unfamiliar with it. I will also attempt to make my app using Blazor. This is in order to better learn how to use it and to stay ahead of the curve. Most of my challanges come from learning how to properly use these tools.

# Challenges
There are many issues that arise with the basic concept behind this app that don't have much to do with coding. The first issue that may arise is that since this app is base on WarmShowers it is assumed that you will be volunteering your home to be used by strangers. This is not the case. You don't need to volunteer you home or even be anywhere near your home in order to help others using this app. Another common problem I see others mention is the fact that most people in need don't have access to an internet connection or even a phone. This is a valid issue but one that has many solutions. Since these issues aren't based around my coding I won't elaborate too much on those solutions.

# Wireframe Sketches
The homepage of my app will display a map that takes up most, if not all, of the space. People who are not logged in will be able to see markers put in by other users and will be able to get directions to that marker. They will also have an option to create an accoount if that want to volunteer, however this will not affect the users ability to see markers placed by volunteers.

A volunteer will have the ability to place a marker on the map for a specific amount of time and place information about their marker. This is roughly what I want it to look like for a volunteer.

# Progress and Challenges
So far I have been able to implement the Google Maps API to display a map on my homepage. That is about as far as I have gotten with any coding. My next step will be completing a requirements traceability matrix. This is so that I can better organize what it is I need to get done, and at which priority. This will also help me get rid of any unnecessary requirements, and develop test cases for my requirements.
