## What is Above The Pale
Above The Pale is a mobile or web app that will help homeless or displaced individuals find assistance. The idea came to me from an app called WarmShowers. WarmShowers is a worldwide hospitality app for touring cyclist. It allows kind-hearted people to provide a home for cyclists who are in the middle of a long ride. It connects those that need a place to stay and the goodwill of those willing to let a cyclists spend the night. 

Above The Pale works in a similar fahsion. It is designed to connect those that need help and those who are willing to provide that help, with the assistance of Google Map API

# Users
## App Perspective From A Volunteer
Someone who wishes to help will be able to create an account. With a [verified](#extra-information) account they will be able to set a point on Google Maps where they wish to provide aid. This can be anywhere from their own homes if they wish to the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. They will be able to specify exactly what it is they are providing. Other users of this app will be able to see where this point is and what is exactly being provided. This can range anywhere from clothing, food, a warm shower, company, a place to stay, or even employment.

## App Perspective From Someone In Need
Someone who has the app and is just looking for aid will not have an account. They will just have access to a map with locations of those willing to provide aid.

## From a Junior Software Developer Perspective
Even though this project is one I've wanted to build for a long time and just a side project, it will allow me to learn a lot of new useful skills. One of those is how to work with the Google Maps API. The Google Maps API will be most of the UI/UX. It is widely used and intuitive for most people. It is also easy to understand and learn for those unfamiliar with it. I will also attempt to make my app using Blazor. This is in order to better learn how to use it and to stay ahead of the curve. Most of my challanges come from learning how to properly use these tools.
